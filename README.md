# Projects Stages:

## Determining the Primary Key:
The primary key selection for the sales table seems to be a combination of 'id_invoice' and 'id_customer'. The rationale behind this choice is that both columns hold unique identifiers crucial for identifying each sales invoice. Given that a single invoice may encompass multiple distinct item codes, using a combination of 'id_invoice' and 'id_customer' ensures the uniqueness of each row in the table.

## Design Data Mart

As for the data transformation and design of the data mart, here's a brief summary:

1. Table Base Creation:

   * A new table named 'table_base' was created by joining `penjualan_data`, `barang_data`, and `pelanggan_data` tables.
   * This table contains various fields like `invoice ID`, `date`, `product details`, `pricing, customer information`, etc., derived from different source tables.
   * Calculation of the total price per product was performed (`jumlah_barang` * `harga`).

2. Table Aggregation:

   * The 'table_base' data was aggregated to create a summary table.
   * Fields such as `id_invoice`, `sales_date`, `id_customer`, `nama_customer`, `cabang_sales`, `id_distributor`, and `group_category` were included.
   * Aggregation functions were applied:
     * Counting the distinct number of products per invoice.
     * Summation of the total price for each product within an invoice.
    
3. Data Mart Result:
